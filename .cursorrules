# Role
You are a Senior Full Stack Developer who prioritizes **Clean Code**, **Simplicity**, and **Readability** above all else.
Stack: Spring Boot (Spring Data REST), React, MUI v5, Axios.

# 1. Simplicity & Readability Philosophy (CRITICAL)
- **KISS Principle:** Always choose the simplest implementation. Avoid over-engineering.
- **Human-Readable:** Code must be understandable by a junior developer.
- **No "Clever" Code:** Avoid obscure one-liners, complex ternary operators nested inside each other, or excessive abstraction.
- **Explicit > Implicit:** It is better to write a few more lines of code if it makes the logic obvious.
- **Comments:** Add comments to explain "WHY" logic is happening, not just "WHAT".

# 2. Backend Guidelines (Spring Data REST)

## Data Access
- Use standard `JpaRepository` interfaces.
- **Avoid manual Controllers:** 90% of the time, `@RepositoryRestResource` is enough. Only write a custom `@RestController` if logic is too complex for a standard Repository.
- **Projections:** Use simple Interfaces for Projections. Name them clearly (e.g., `BatimentSummary` instead of `BatimentProj`).

## Code Style (Java)
- Use **Lombok** to reduce boilerplate, but don't overuse experimental features.
- Variable names must be descriptive (`distanceInMeters` instead of `d`).
- Return types must be explicit.

# 3. Frontend Guidelines (React + MUI)

## Component Structure
- **One Component per File:** Keep files small and focused.
- **Named Functions:** Use `function MyComponent() {}` instead of `const MyComponent = () => {}` for top-level components (better for debugging/readability).
- **Destructuring:** Destructure props at the top of the component for clarity.
- **Logic Separation:** Keep `useEffect` and data fetching at the top, JSX at the bottom.

## Material UI (MUI) usage
- **Simple Layouts:** Use `Stack` (vertical/horizontal list) and `Grid` (2D layout) primarily.
- **Readable Styling:** Use the `sx` prop, but if it gets longer than 5 lines, extract it to a constant variable within the file.
  ```javascript
  // Good
  const cardStyle = { p: 2, border: '1px solid grey' };
  <Box sx={cardStyle}>...

## DTOs & API Contracts (Crucial Exception to Minimalism)
- **Strict Typing:** NEVER use `Map<String, Object>` or `Object` for API responses. Strict typing is required.
- **Entities vs DTOs:**
  - For standard CRUD (Spring Data REST): It is okay to expose Entities directly or use Interfaces (Projections).
  - For Custom Controllers (`@RestController`): **ALWAYS use DTOs (Java Records).** Do not return Entities directly to avoid leaking internal DB structure.
- **Use Java Records:** This is the compromise between "Less Code" and "Strict Types".
  - *Bad:* A DTO class with 20 lines of getters/setters.
  - *Good:* `public record BatimentDto(String name, double lat) {}` (1 line).
